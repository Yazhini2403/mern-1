        <p>A broken tulip (Tulipa) with streaks of yellow and red. Such coloration is the 
        result of infection by the Tulip breaking virus.Tulip cultivation likely began in Persia 
        (Iran) in the 10th century, and it eventually became a symbol of the Ottoman Empire. 
        Tulips were introduced to the Western world by Augier Ghislain de Busbecq, the Viennese
         ambassador to Turkey, who wrote of seeing the plants in Edirne, Turkey, in 1551
          and later sent some seeds to Austria. The arrival at Antwerp in 1562 of a cargo of 
          tulip bulbs from Constantinople (now Istanbul) marked the beginning of the horticultural tulip industry in Europe.</p>
